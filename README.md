Digital COVID-19 Vaccination Record Scanner
====

Herein lies a project that decodes the QR codes given out by California's Department of Public Health.  Written in a mishmash of Rust and JavaScript, it will give you a quick go/no-go if the data have been signed by DPH and indicate a fully vaccinated status.

QR barcodes from other companies and public health agencies (e.g. Qu√©bec Ministry of Health and Social Services, UCSD, Get Real Health, Epic, etc.) are compatible so long as they adhere to the SMART Health Card specification.
